# Structural Drying Tracker

The Structural Drying Tracker helps you create professional documentation for water damage restoration jobs. It tracks moisture readings, equipment deployment, and atmospheric conditions throughout the drying process, then generates polished PDF reports for insurance companies and your own records.

## What It Does

- **Professional Documentation** - Create thorough, organized records that stand up to insurance scrutiny
- **Moisture Tracking** - Monitor specific reference points in each affected room over time
- **Equipment Logging** - Track dehumidifiers, air movers, and other equipment by room and day
- **Atmospheric Monitoring** - Record temperature, humidity, and GPP readings to demonstrate proper drying conditions
- **PDF Reports** - Generate comprehensive reports with one click, ready to send to adjusters or keep on file
- **IICRC-Compliant** - Follow industry-standard monitoring practices that insurance companies expect

## Getting Started - The Setup Wizard

Access the drying tracker from any job's **Drying** tab. The setup wizard walks you through four steps to configure your drying project.

### Step 1: Affected Rooms

List all water-damaged areas that need monitoring. Be specific with room names so your reports are clear.

**Examples:**
- Kitchen
- Master Bedroom
- Hallway Closet
- Basement Storage

You can add as many rooms as needed. Each room will get its own set of reference points and equipment tracking.

### Step 2: Drying Chambers (Optional)

If you are using contained drying with sealed areas, define your drying chambers here. This step is optional - skip it if you are doing open-air drying.

**Chamber Types:**
- **Containment** - Fully sealed area with plastic barriers
- **Open** - Unsealed area with directed airflow
- **Cavity** - Wall cavities or other enclosed spaces being dried

Chambers help you group rooms and track atmospheric conditions in specific containment zones.

### Step 3: Assign Rooms to Chambers (Optional)

If you created chambers in Step 2, link each affected room to its chamber. This connects your room readings to the appropriate atmospheric data.

Skip this step if you are not using chambers.

### Step 4: Room Setup

This is where you configure the details for each affected room. Take your time here - good setup makes daily monitoring much faster.

**Reference Points**

Reference points are the specific spots where you will take moisture readings. Add a point for each material or location you need to monitor.

Examples:
- Drywall behind toilet (12" from floor)
- Carpet center of room
- Hardwood near entry
- Baseboard north wall
- Subfloor under vanity

The more specific you are, the more useful your documentation becomes.

**Baselines**

For each reference point, set a target dry percentage. This is the moisture level the material should reach before you consider it dry.

Baselines depend on the material type and pre-loss conditions. Common targets:
- Drywall: 12-15%
- Hardwood: 6-9%
- Carpet/pad: 10-12%
- Concrete: 14-18%

When readings hit or drop below baseline, the system marks that point as dry.

**Equipment**

Enter the initial equipment count for each room:
- Dehumidifiers
- Air movers
- Fans
- Injectidry systems
- Other specialty equipment

This gives you a starting point for daily equipment tracking.

## Daily Monitoring

Once setup is complete, you will record readings each day until the structure is dry. The tracker makes this straightforward.

### Moisture Readings

Enter the percentage reading for each reference point. The system color-codes each reading so you can see status at a glance:

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **DRY** | Green | At or below baseline target |
| **DRYING** | Yellow | Making progress, trending down |
| **WET** | Orange | Still elevated above baseline |
| **VERY WET** | Red | Significantly elevated, needs attention |

Watch for readings that are not improving or are getting worse - these may indicate hidden water sources or equipment issues.

### Atmospheric Readings

Record temperature and relative humidity for different areas. The system calculates GPP (Grains Per Pound) automatically, which measures actual moisture in the air.

**Where to record:**
- **Outside** - Ambient exterior conditions
- **Unaffected Area** - Dry area of the structure for comparison
- **Chamber Interior** - Inside your containment zones
- **Equipment Exhaust** - Output from dehumidifiers

**Understanding GPP:**

| GPP Range | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Below 40 | Good drying conditions |
| 40-60 | Acceptable, drying should progress |
| 60-100 | Active drying needed, check equipment |
| Above 135 | Problem - check for water intrusion or equipment failure |

If GPP stays high despite running equipment, look for ongoing water sources like leaks, ground water, or moisture migrating from other areas.

### Equipment Counts

Record the equipment count for each room each day. The previous day's count auto-populates, so you only need to update if something changed.

This creates an equipment deployment log showing exactly what was running where and for how long.

### Daily Notes

Add observations, site conditions, or concerns. Notes become part of your permanent record and PDF reports.

Good notes to include:
- Weather conditions affecting the job
- Access issues or homeowner concerns
- Equipment adjustments made and why
- Observations about drying progress
- Anything unusual you noticed

Notes matter when disputes arise months later. What seems obvious today will not be remembered next year.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard gives you a quick overview of the entire drying project:

- **Room Status** - See which rooms are at goal and which need more time
- **Progress Tracking** - Watch moisture levels trend down over time
- **Visual Indicators** - Color-coded status for each room makes problem areas obvious
- **Days Active** - Track how long the drying project has been running

Use the dashboard to quickly assess the job each morning and identify where to focus your attention.

## Generating PDF Reports

Click the **Generate Report** button to create a professional PDF document. Reports are formatted for insurance documentation and include everything adjusters need to see.

**Report Contents:**

- **Job Information** - Client name, address, claim number, dates of service
- **Insurance Details** - Carrier, adjuster, policy information
- **Moisture Reading History** - Complete log of all readings, color-coded by status
- **Atmospheric Conditions** - Temperature, humidity, and GPP readings over time
- **Equipment Deployment Log** - Daily equipment counts by room
- **Equipment Summary** - Total equipment-days calculation for billing
- **Daily Notes** - All observations and documentation

**Use Reports For:**

- **Insurance Documentation** - Prove proper drying procedures were followed
- **Customer Records** - Give homeowners professional documentation of the work
- **Legal Protection** - Detailed records protect you if questions arise later
- **Professional Presentation** - Show clients and adjusters you run a professional operation

Reports can be generated at any time during the project or after completion. Generate interim reports for long jobs to show progress.

## Tips for Success

**Set Accurate Baselines**

Research typical dry percentages for each material type. Consider pre-loss conditions - a basement that was always slightly damp will have different targets than a climate-controlled living room.

**Take Readings at the Same Time**

Consistency matters. Take readings at the same time each day so your trending data is meaningful. Morning readings before equipment has been running all day give you true progress indicators.

**Document Everything**

When in doubt, write it down. Notes about site conditions, homeowner conversations, equipment issues, or anything unusual protect you later. Insurance disputes often happen months after the job - your notes are your memory.

**Use Chamber Readings for Contained Drying**

If you are doing sealed containment, always record chamber atmospheric readings. These prove you maintained proper drying conditions inside the containment, which is critical for insurance documentation.

**Monitor GPP Trends**

Falling GPP indicates drying is progressing. Flat or rising GPP means something is wrong. Pay attention to these trends - they tell you more about actual drying progress than individual moisture readings.

**Check Equipment Daily**

Equipment fails. Dehumidifiers fill up, air movers get unplugged, breakers trip. Your daily equipment count forces you to verify everything is running. Catch problems early before they extend the job.

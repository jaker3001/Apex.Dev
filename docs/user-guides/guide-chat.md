## Starting a Conversation

### Opening the Assistant

Click **Assistant** in the top navigation bar to open the chat interface. You will see:

- A message area in the center (empty when starting fresh)
- A sidebar on the left showing your conversation history
- An input bar at the bottom for typing messages

### Starting a New Chat

Click the **New Chat** button in the sidebar to begin a fresh conversation. This clears the current chat and gives you a clean slate.

Use a new chat when you are switching to a completely different topic. The assistant performs better when conversations stay focused on related subjects.

### Resuming Previous Conversations

Your recent conversations appear in the **Recent** section of the sidebar. Each entry shows:

- The conversation title (generated from your first message)
- The time or date of your last message

Click any conversation to pick up where you left off. The assistant remembers everything from that chat and can continue helping with the same topic.

To delete an old conversation, hover over it and click the trash icon that appears.

---

## Chat Interface

The chat window is designed to feel like a natural conversation.

### Message Display

- **Your messages** appear on the right side with a distinct background
- **Assistant responses** appear on the left side
- Messages flow from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom

When the assistant is thinking or generating a response, you will see a typing indicator. For longer responses, text streams in as it is generated so you do not have to wait for the complete answer.

### Sending Messages

Type your message in the text box at the bottom of the screen.

- Press **Enter** to send your message
- Press **Shift+Enter** to add a new line without sending

The send button (arrow icon) on the right also sends your message when clicked.

While the assistant is responding, the send button changes to a stop button. Click it to cancel the response if needed.

## Choosing AI Models

The assistant can use different AI models, each with its own strengths. Click the **gear icon** in the input bar to open the options menu.

### Available Models

**Sonnet 4.5** (Default)
The best all-around choice for daily work. Fast responses with strong reasoning ability. Handles estimate reviews, email drafting, and most tasks well. This is selected by default and works great for most situations.

**Opus 4.5**
The most intelligent model available. Takes a bit longer but provides deeper analysis and handles complex multi-step problems. Use this when you need thorough review of complicated estimates, detailed research, or when Sonnet's answer was not quite right.

**Sonnet 4**
The previous version, still very capable. Slightly faster than Sonnet 4.5 with good overall performance. A solid backup option.

**Haiku 4.5**
The quickest and most economical option. Best for simple questions, quick lookups, or when you need a fast answer to something straightforward. Not recommended for complex analysis.

### Switching Models Mid-Conversation

You can change models at any time during a conversation. If you start with Sonnet and realize you need deeper analysis, switch to Opus for your next question. The assistant will continue the same conversation with the new model's capabilities.

## Chat Mode vs Agent Mode

The assistant has two operating modes. Click the gear icon in the input bar to switch between them.

### Chat Mode

Simple, focused conversations. Best for:

- Asking questions and getting explanations
- Drafting emails and documents
- Discussing strategy and options
- Research and general help

In Chat Mode, you can attach a **Project** (explained below) to give the assistant helpful context about what you are working on.

### Agent Mode

Full power mode with access to tools. The assistant can:

- Read and write files on your computer
- Run commands and scripts
- Connect to external services through MCP tools
- Use specialized sub-agents for specific tasks

Use Agent Mode when you need the assistant to actually do things, not just discuss them. The sidebar shows available agents, MCP servers, and skills when in this mode.

## Attaching Files

The assistant can read and analyze files you share. Click the **paperclip icon** in the input bar to attach files.

### Supported File Types

**Documents**
- Text files (.txt, .csv, .json)
- Code files (.py, .js, .html, .css)
- Markdown files (.md)
- Configuration files (.yaml, .xml)

**Images**
- Photos (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp)
- Screenshots
- Damage documentation photos

**PDFs**
- Xactimate estimates
- Insurance documents
- Contracts and agreements

### How to Use Attachments

1. Click the paperclip icon
2. Select one or more files from your computer
3. Files appear as previews above the input box
4. Type your question about the files
5. Press Enter to send

The assistant will analyze the files and respond based on your question.

### Great Uses for File Attachments

**Damage Photos**: Share photos from a job site and ask the assistant to describe what it sees, identify damage types, or suggest documentation improvements.

**Estimates**: Upload Xactimate PDFs and ask the assistant to review line items, check for missing items, or help with pricing questions.

**Adjuster Correspondence**: Share emails or letters and get help drafting professional responses.

## Chat Projects

Projects help you organize conversations around specific contexts, like a particular insurance company or type of work.

### What Projects Do

When you select a project before chatting, the assistant automatically knows:

- Custom instructions you have set (like tone or formatting preferences)
- Any linked job for automatic context
- The type of work or client you are dealing with

### Creating a Project

1. Make sure you are in **Chat Mode** (not Agent Mode)
2. In the sidebar, click **New Project** under the Projects section
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: Something descriptive like "State Farm Claims" or "Commercial Jobs"
   - **Description**: Optional notes about what this project covers
   - **Instructions**: Specific guidance for the assistant (e.g., "Always be extra formal" or "Focus on IICRC S500 standards")
   - **Linked Job**: Optionally connect to a specific job number for context

### Using Projects

Click a project in the sidebar to select it. The project name will be highlighted, indicating it is active.

Now when you chat, the assistant applies that project's instructions automatically. Click the project again to deselect it.

### Example Projects

**"State Farm Claims"**
Instructions: "When drafting communications, be professional but firm. Reference policy language when appropriate. State Farm adjusters prefer concise bullet points."

**"Water Mitigation"**
Instructions: "Focus on IICRC S500 standards for water damage. Include moisture readings and drying goals in documentation."

**"Commercial Work"**
Instructions: "Use formal business language. Include timeline estimates and project management considerations."

## Tips for Best Results

Getting the most from the assistant comes down to clear communication and good habits.

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Help with this estimate"

Try: "Review this estimate for a kitchen water loss. Check if the drying equipment and labor hours seem reasonable for a 200 square foot affected area."

### Provide Context

The assistant works better when it understands the situation. Mention:

- Type of loss (water, fire, mold, etc.)
- Insurance company if relevant
- Any specific concerns or goals
- What outcome you are looking for

### Attach Relevant Files

When discussing estimates, photos, or documents, attach them directly rather than describing them. The assistant can analyze the actual content and give more accurate help.

### Use Projects for Repeated Contexts

If you regularly work with certain insurance companies or types of jobs, create projects with your preferred instructions. This saves time and keeps responses consistent.

### Switch to Opus for Complex Analysis

If Sonnet's answer seems incomplete or you are dealing with something complicated, switch to Opus for your follow-up questions. It takes more time but provides deeper analysis.

### Keep Conversations Focused

Start new chats when switching to unrelated topics. The assistant performs better with focused conversations than long chats covering many different subjects.

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

If an answer is not quite what you needed, ask for clarification or a different approach. The assistant learns from your feedback within the conversation and adjusts its responses.

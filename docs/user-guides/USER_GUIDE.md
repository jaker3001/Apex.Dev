## Introduction

- **Calendar** - See your schedule and upcoming appointments
- **People Directory** - Manage contacts for clients, adjusters, subcontractors, and insurance companies
- **Document Storage** - Keep important files organized and accessible
- **Quick Capture** - Instantly save notes, photos, or tasks from anywhere in the app

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Application

During development, Apex Assistant runs on your local computer. To access the application:

1. Make sure the application server is running (your technical administrator will set this up)
2. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge all work well)
3. Go to the following address:
   - **Main Application**: `http://localhost:5173`

Tip: You can bookmark this address in your browser for easy access. Just click the star icon in your browser's address bar.

Note: The application needs to be running on your computer or a server to work. If you see an error message saying the page cannot be reached, contact your technical administrator.

### First-Time Login

When you first open Apex Assistant:

1. You will see the login screen
2. Enter your email address
3. Enter your password
4. Click the **Sign In** button

If you do not have login credentials yet, contact your administrator to set up your account.

Tip: Check the "Remember me" box if you are using your own computer. This keeps you logged in so you do not have to enter your password every time.

### Understanding the Interface

The Apex Assistant interface is designed to be clean and easy to navigate. Here is what you will see:

**The Top Navigation Bar** runs across the top of the screen. This is your main way to move between different sections of the application. It stays visible no matter where you are.

**The Sidebar** appears on the left side of the screen. What you see here changes depending on which section you are in. For example, when you are in Jobs, the sidebar shows job filters and search. When you are in the Assistant, it shows your conversation history.

**The Main Content Area** takes up most of the screen. This is where you do your actual work - viewing job details, chatting with the assistant, or managing tasks.

**The Quick Capture Button** is the orange circle with a plus sign (+) in the bottom right corner. This powerful button lets you quickly add notes, tasks, or photos from anywhere in the app.

The application uses a modern dark theme with frosted glass-style cards that make information easy to read. Important items are highlighted in orange, your brand color.

## Navigating the App

### Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar is always visible at the top of your screen. It contains:

**The Apex Logo** (far left) - Click this anytime to return to the Dashboard home page.

**Eight Main Sections** (center):

| Icon | Name | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| Grid | **Dashboard** | Your home base with today's tasks, weather, and quick stats |
| Robot | **Assistant** | Chat with the AI assistant |
| Calendar | **Calendar** | View your schedule and appointments |
| Checkbox | **Tasks** | Manage your to-do lists |
| Briefcase | **Jobs** | Track all your restoration projects |
| Inbox | **Inbox** | Quick captures and incoming items |
| People | **People** | Contacts directory for clients, adjusters, and vendors |
| Document | **Docs** | Access stored documents and files |

**Notification Bell** (right side) - Shows alerts and updates. A red badge appears when you have new notifications.

**Settings Gear** (right side) - Access application settings and configuration.

**Your Profile Picture** (far right) - Shows you are logged in. Click for account options.

To navigate, simply click on the section you want to visit. The current section is highlighted so you always know where you are.

Tip: On smaller screens or tablets, some navigation labels may be hidden to save space. The icons still work the same way.

### Contextual Sidebars

One of Apex Assistant's smart features is that the sidebar changes based on where you are in the app. This keeps the most relevant options close at hand without cluttering the screen.

**Dashboard Sidebar** shows:
- Quick Capture button for fast input
- Today's tasks (My Day)
- Today's calendar events
- Time tracking shortcuts
- Upcoming items this week
- Recent activity feed

**Assistant Sidebar** shows:
- Your conversation history
- Options to start new conversations
- Conversation search

**Jobs Sidebar** shows:
- Job search and filters
- Job status categories
- Quick access to recent jobs

**Tasks Sidebar** shows:
- Task lists and categories
- Filter options (Today, Upcoming, Completed)
- Quick add task button

**Calendar Sidebar** shows:
- Mini calendar for date navigation
- Event categories
- Quick filters

**Settings Sidebar** shows:
- Different settings categories
- AI Agents configuration
- Skills management
- MCP connections
- Analytics

Some sections like **Inbox**, **People**, and **Docs** are simpler pages that do not need a sidebar, so nothing appears on the left when you visit those areas.

### Quick Capture Button

The Quick Capture button is the large orange circle with a plus sign (+) floating in the bottom right corner of your screen. It is always visible, no matter which section you are in.

**To use Quick Capture:**

1. Click the orange (+) button
2. The button rotates and four options appear above it:
   - **Note** (blue) - Capture a quick text note
   - **Task** (green) - Add a new task to your list
   - **Photo** (purple) - Take or upload a photo
   - **Audio** (red) - Record a voice memo
3. Click the option you want
4. Enter your information
5. Click outside or press the (+) button again to close

**Why Quick Capture is useful:**

Imagine you are reviewing a job and remember something you need to do. Instead of navigating to Tasks, you can hit Quick Capture, add the task, and continue what you were doing. It saves time and helps you capture ideas before you forget them.

Tip: Quick Capture is especially handy when you are on a phone call or walking through a job site. Capture the thought immediately, then organize it later.

### The Dashboard

The Dashboard is your home page - the first thing you see after logging in. It gives you a quick overview of your day and important business metrics.

**My Day Tasks** - Shows tasks you have marked for today. This helps you focus on what needs to get done now.

**Weather Widget** - Displays current weather conditions. Useful for planning outdoor restoration work.

**Today's Schedule** - Shows upcoming appointments and events from your calendar.

**Project Stats** - Quick numbers on active jobs, pending estimates, and other key metrics.

**Recent Activity** - Shows what has been happening in the system - new jobs, status changes, payments received.

**To return to the Dashboard** from anywhere in the app:
- Click the **Apex** logo in the top left, or
- Click the **Dashboard** icon (grid) in the navigation bar

The Dashboard is designed to give you everything you need in the first few seconds of your day. Check it each morning to see what is on your plate and stay on top of your business.

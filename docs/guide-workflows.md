4. If helpful, attach the relevant document:
   - The original estimate
   - The adjuster's response
   - Photos of the additional damage
5. The assistant will provide:
   - Reference to specific IICRC S500 or S520 standards
   - Professional language for your supplement letter
   - Technical justification for the line item

### Creating the Supplement

1. Open the job in Apex Assistant
2. Go to the Accounting sidebar
3. Click **Add Estimate**
4. Title it clearly (e.g., "Supplement #1 - Antimicrobial" or "Supplement - Additional Mold")
5. Enter the supplemental amount (just the additional, not the total)
6. In the description, summarize the additional scope
7. Upload the supplement Xactimate file
8. Set status to **Submitted**
9. Save

### Tracking the Supplement

## Workflow 6: Drafting an Adjuster Email

When you need to communicate with an insurance adjuster about a claim, the AI assistant can help you write professional, effective emails.

### Getting Started

1. Click **Assistant** in the top navigation
2. For important or complex communications, select **Opus** as the model (use the model selector)
3. Create a project for this insurance carrier if you communicate with them often:
   - Projects keep context across conversations
   - The assistant learns your history with this carrier

### Writing the Email

4. Explain the situation to the assistant:
   - What job is this about?
   - What is the issue or request?
   - What outcome do you want?

   Example: "I need to email the adjuster at ABC Insurance about job 2024-0156. They denied the containment setup but we had Category 3 water. I need them to reconsider."

5. The assistant will draft a professional email that:
   - States the facts clearly
   - References appropriate standards
   - Maintains a professional but firm tone
   - Requests specific action

6. Review the draft:
   - Does it accurately represent the situation?
   - Is the tone right? Ask for adjustments if needed
   - Are all the facts correct?

7. Copy the final text to your email client

### Tips for Effective Adjuster Communication

- **Be specific**: Reference exact line items, amounts, and estimate versions
- **Cite standards**: IICRC S500, S520, or manufacturer requirements carry weight
- **Stay factual**: Avoid emotional language even when frustrated
- **Request action**: Be clear about what you are asking them to do
- **Document everything**: Save copies of all correspondence in the job's Documents tab

## Personal Productivity Tools

### Task Management

The task management system helps you organize your work and stay on top of your daily priorities. Think of it as a digital to-do list that actually works the way you think.

#### Your Task Lists

Every task you create lives in one or more lists. Here are the built-in lists:

| List | Color | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **My Day** | Orange | Tasks you want to focus on today |
| **Important** | Yellow | Starred high-priority items |
| **Planned** | Green | Tasks with future due dates |
| **Inbox** | Blue | Quick captures and unsorted tasks |
| **Custom Lists** | Your choice | Create your own categories |

**My Day** is your daily focus list. Tasks here are what you commit to working on today. This list resets each day, so you start fresh every morning.

**Important** contains anything you've starred. Use this for tasks that matter most, regardless of when they're due.

**Planned** automatically shows tasks with due dates. This helps you see what's coming up.

**Inbox** is your catch-all. When you're not sure where something belongs, throw it in the Inbox and sort it later.

**Custom Lists** let you organize tasks your way. Create lists like "Waiting On Insurance," "Equipment to Order," or "Follow Up Next Week."

#### Working with Tasks

**Creating Tasks:**
- Click the "Add Task" button in any list view
- Type your task and press Enter
- The task appears in that list immediately

**Task Details:**
Each task can have:
- **Due date and time** - When does this need to be done?
- **Priority level** - Low, medium, or high
- **Subtasks** - Break big tasks into smaller steps
- **Notes** - Add details or context

**Quick Actions:**
- Click the **star icon** to mark a task as Important
- Click the **sun icon** to add a task to My Day
- Click the **checkbox** to mark complete

**Subtasks:**
For bigger projects, break them down. Open a task and add subtasks underneath it. For example:
- "Complete Smith water damage estimate"
  - Take final moisture readings
  - Upload all photos to Xactimate
  - Write line item justifications
  - Review with office manager

#### My Day Workflow

Here's how to get the most out of My Day:

1. **Start each morning** by opening My Day
2. **Review your tasks** from Important and Planned lists
3. **Add to My Day** the tasks you can realistically complete today
4. **Work through your list** during the day
5. **Check off tasks** as you finish them

Completed tasks move to a separate "Completed" section so you can see your progress without them cluttering your active list.

**Tip:** Be realistic about how much you can do. It's better to complete a short list than to end every day with leftover tasks.

### Quick Capture / Inbox

When you're in the field or on a call, you don't have time to organize everything perfectly. Quick Capture lets you save information fast and sort it later.

#### Capture Anything Fast

The **Quick Capture button** is always visible in the app. Click it to save:

| Type | What It's For |
|------|---------------|
| **Notes** | Text ideas, reminders, things to remember |
| **Tasks** | Quick to-dos that pop into your head |
| **Photos** | Images from your phone or computer |
| **Audio** | Voice memos when you can't type |
| **Documents** | PDFs, spreadsheets, Word docs |

**Example:** You're at a job site and notice ceiling damage the adjuster missed. Snap a photo with Quick Capture, link it to the job, and keep working. You'll process it later when you're back at the office.

#### Job Linking

This is where Quick Capture becomes powerful for restoration work.

When you capture something, you can **link it to a specific job**. This connects that photo, note, or document directly to the project record.

**Field Work Made Easy:**
1. Take a damage photo
2. Hit Quick Capture
3. Select the photo
4. Link to the job number
5. Done - it's attached to the job

Later, when you're writing estimates or responding to the adjuster, all your captures are organized by job.

#### Processing Your Inbox

Your Inbox collects everything you've captured. Make it a habit to process it regularly:

1. **Open your Inbox** (daily or a few times per week)
2. **Review each item**
3. **Decide what to do:**
   - Convert a note to a proper task
   - Move a photo to the job's media folder
   - Delete things you no longer need
4. **Mark as processed** when handled

A clean Inbox means nothing falls through the cracks.

### Time Tracking

Track your hours to understand where your time goes and support job costing.

#### Clock In/Out

The time tracker works like a simple punch clock:

- **Clock In** when you start working
- **Clock Out** when you finish
- **Add notes** about what you worked on
- **Link to a job** if the time was for a specific project

#### Features

**Today's View:**
- See your total hours worked today
- View your current session if clocked in
- Track break time separately

**History:**
- Look back at any date range
- See daily, weekly, or monthly totals
- Filter by job to see time spent on specific projects

**Edit Entries:**
- Forgot to clock out? Edit the entry
- Need to split time between jobs? Adjust the records
- Made a mistake? Correct it easily

#### For Job Costing

Time tracking feeds directly into your job financials:

- **Labor costs** are calculated from time entries
- **Billable vs. non-billable** hours stay separate
- **Job profitability** becomes clearer when you see actual labor time

**Example:** You spend 3 hours at the Johnson property doing demo. Log that time linked to the job. When you review job costs later, those 3 hours show up in labor expenses.

### Personal Notes (Knowledge Base)

Build your own reference library. Store procedures, client notes, lessons learned, and anything else you want to remember.

#### Build Your Knowledge

Notes use **Markdown** formatting, which is simple text with basic styling. You don't need to learn anything complex - just type naturally. Use asterisks for *italic* or **bold**, and dashes for bullet points.

#### Features

**Create and Organize:**
- Create notes on any topic
- Organize into folders
- Search across all your notes instantly

**Easy Editing:**
- Write in a clean editor
- Preview how it will look
- Auto-save protects your work (no need to hit Save constantly)

**Linking:**
- **Backlinks** show you which notes reference each other
- **Job links** connect notes to projects using `[[job:123]]` syntax
- Build a web of connected information over time

#### Use For

**Procedures and Checklists:**
- Water damage response steps
- Equipment maintenance schedules
- New employee training guides

**Client Notes:**
- Property-specific details
- Past claim history
- Communication preferences

**Lessons Learned:**
- What went wrong on a difficult job
- How you solved a tricky problem
- Tips from training or conferences

**Reference Material:**
- IICRC standards summaries
- Insurance company contact info
- Pricing guidelines

**Tip:** The more you add to your knowledge base, the more valuable it becomes. When you solve a problem or learn something new, take two minutes to write it down.

### Dashboard Integration

Your **My Hub** dashboard brings everything together in one view.

#### What You'll See

**My Day Tasks:**
- Your focused tasks for today appear front and center
- Check them off right from the dashboard
- See at a glance what you need to accomplish

**Recent Inbox Items:**
- Latest captures show up here
- Quickly process new items
- Nothing gets buried or forgotten

**Quick Access:**
- Jump to any productivity feature with one click
- See notifications and alerts
- Get an overview of your workday

The dashboard is designed to be your starting point each morning. Open it, review your day, and get to work.

## Tips for Success

1. **Use My Day every day.** Make it your morning ritual to plan your focus tasks.

2. **Capture first, organize later.** Don't let the need to categorize slow you down in the field.

3. **Process your Inbox regularly.** A weekly Inbox review keeps things manageable.

4. **Link captures to jobs.** This small habit saves huge time later when you need to find something.

5. **Build your knowledge base gradually.** Add one note per week about something you learned.

6. **Track time consistently.** Even rough tracking is better than none for understanding job costs.
